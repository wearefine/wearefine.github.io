# FINE Developer Pages

We do work. Plus, we share.

## Adding pages

Pages can be added in the root directory with a `.md` or `.html` extension. They must be formatted with [front matter](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-jekyll/#front-matter-is-required) at the top of the document. Some extended meta is required for proper display:

| Key | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `layout` | `required` | Type. Accepts `null`, `default`, or `page`. `page` is recommended for most scenarios |
| `title` | `required` | Project name. (i.e. "Fryr") |
| `repository_slug` | `required` | Parameterized project name separated by dashes (should match the GitHub URL, i.e. `frob-core`) |
| `permalink` | `required` | Project location on `github.io` docs (should match `repository_slug` with leading and trailing dashes, i.e. `/frob-core/`) |
| `tagline` | `required` | Project description (i.e. "A command-line lint warrior") |
| `logo` | | File name, with the file located in the `_includes` folder (i.e. `maximus.svg`). Assumes `title` if not supplied |
| `js_download` | | Links directly to `<project-slug>.js` in the project's root folder, `master` branch. Accepts `true` or `false` (assumes `false` if not supplied) |
| `zip_download` | | Links directly to GitHub's ZIP of the project. Accepts `true` or `false` (assumes `false` if not supplied) |

## Local Development

1. `git clone git@github.com:wearefine/wearefine.github.io.git`
1. `ruby 2.2 <=`
1. `bundle install`

Run `jekyll server` to serve the site at `http://localhost:4000`. Some links will not work because they rely on variables generated by GitHub on build.
